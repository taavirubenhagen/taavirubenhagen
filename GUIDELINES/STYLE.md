## Code



### Program design

##### *Conciseness is the most important aspect of readability.*

Only extract functions, classes or whatever when you use them multiple times.

*TODO: Add example for multiple uses (then extracting is highly encouraged)*

❌
    exampleFunction() {
        if condition {
            doEveryThing()
            return
        }
        doOtherThings()
    }

    /// This may increase readablity in the exampleFunction, but is drastically more verbose and readers have to switch between functions many times.
    doEverything() {
        doThings()
        doMoreThings()
        doCleanupThings()
    }


✔️
    exampleFunction() {
        if condition {
            doThings()
            doMoreThings()
            doCleanupThings()
            return
        }
        doOtherThings()
    }


Keep statements on one line when possible, or at least chain them together without duplication. Declare a variable when you want to use the value multiple times.

❌
    const firstParent = ParentType1()
    const secondParent = ParentType2()
    const child = firstParent.haveSex(secondParent)
    const wordGenerator = WordGenerator(options: wordGeneratorOptions)
    const firstWord = wordGenerator.getFirstWord()
    const secondWord = wordGenerator.getSecondWord()
    const thirdWord = wordGenerator.getThirdWord()
    const firstWords = firstWord ++ secondWord ++ thirdWord
    child.say(firstWords)
    child.kill()


✔️
    const wordGenerator = WordGenerator(options: wordGeneratorOptions)
    // Generates child and makes it speak three words, then kills it.
    ParentType1().haveSex(ParentType2())
        .say(wordGenerator.getFirstWord() ++ wordGenerator.getSecondWord() ++ wordGenerator.getThirdWord())
        .kill()



## Formatting

Always indent by four spaces.
