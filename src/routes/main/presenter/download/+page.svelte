        <br/><br/>
        2. You might get antivirus warnings since I don't have the money to buy expensive security certificates for the app.
        These certificates are basically just an identity proof though and change nothing about the actual security of the program.
        If you are concerned about getting malware, just keep in mind that my contact info is public
        and I could therefore be made fully responsible if I tried to hack you, so that would be very stupid of me.<br/><br/>
        3. Refer to the <p3 class="font-bold"></p3><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/zjYiOR03C8M"><B>video tutorial</B> <Icon name="open-new-window"/></a> if you don't know how to dismiss the warning.
        <p3 class="font-bold"></p3>If prompted, allow "Communication in private networks".</p3> This is necessary since the communication between the devices uses WiFi.<br/><br/>
        5. When you want to present, open this app as well as your PowerPoint presentation and use the mobile app to connect and control the presentation.<br/><br/>
