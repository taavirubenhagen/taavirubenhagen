# Tavy Icons


## Icon Versioning

The Tavy Icons are divided in different versions. The icons designed for every version are stored in the corresponding subdirectory of the *icons* directory.
Every one of these subdirectories contains a README.md file describing the characteristics that a shared by every icon of the version to make them consistent.


## Figma Integration

*Until I have implemented an automatic upload of the Figma files to this repository, this section is only useful for me or collaborators with access to my private Figma files.*

In Figma, every icon is stored with its descriptive name, not including the version.
The compliance with the guidelines for the version it should be used with is checked only at the moment of the upload to this repository.
