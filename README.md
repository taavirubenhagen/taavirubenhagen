# Hi, I'm Taavi Rübenhagen.

I love writing blazingly fast next-gen-software with a holistic approach and bleeding-edge technologies to deliver highly interactive experiences everywhere in the world.




## Flagship projects

I developed the
[Presentation Master](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tavy.presentationmaster&hl=en&gl=US)
([for iOS click here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/presentation-master-remote/id1623364174)))"
and Simplest Counter (coming soon) apps, along with some standardized Flutter Components to simplify the development of both.
More is going to follow. Visit my [website](https://taavirubenhagen.netlify.app) for more details.

I'm 17 btw




## This repository

Here, i store the code for my website as well as other important project data, like my ultra-minimalist set of UI icons. Everything is still under active deveploment and far from being ready for production/monetazation (how tf is this spelled lol).
