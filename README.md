# Hi, I'm Taavi Rübenhagen.

I love writing blazingly fast next-gen-software with a holistic approach and bleeding-edge technologies to deliver highly interactive experiences everywhere in the world.

I'm 17 btw




## Flagship projects

I developed the
[Presentation Master](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tavy.presentationmaster&hl=en&gl=US)
([for iOS click here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/presentation-master-remote/id1623364174)))"
and Simplest Counter (coming soon) apps, along with some standardized Flutter Components to simplify the development of both.
More is going to follow. Visit my [website](https://taavirubenhagen.netlify.app) for more details.




## This repository

Here, i store the code for my website as well as other important project data, like my ultra-minimalist set of UI icons and design guidelines. Everything is still under active deveploment and far from being ready for production/monetazation (how tf is this spelled lol). Therefore, every piece of documentation, including this file, is even farer from being finished and should not be trusted.



### Important files

Many files in the code for this website are very important for me, mostly because I plan to reuse them for future projects since they are the best implementation of the Tavy Design System. A list is in the *important_files.md* file in this directory.



### Projects contained here


#### Website *(β)*

Just [check it out](https://taavirubenhagen.netlify.app).


#### Tavy Design System

The design you see everywhere in my projects is mostly based on my ultra-minimalist Tavy Design System, which is optimized for designer/developer experience and created to make it as simple as possible for a single person to use a clean, content-oriented, beautiful and, most of all, consistent design system. More information is in the *DESIGN* directory.


#### *Icons & Graphics*

##### Tavy Icons *(α, β)*

Different pre-release versions are in the *static/icons* directory, ready-to-use beta-stage icons on my [website](https://taavirubenhagen.netlify.app/me/design/tavy/icons).

##### Logos *(α, β, ✓)*

Logos designed or used by me are in the *static/logos* directory.
